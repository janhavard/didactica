Simple portable app for interacting with the ChatGPT in a bit more advanced way.

Current prototype has one input for task description, one input for the text to be evaluated according to description.

## Intended use case
Evaluating student tests, and summarizing common areas the student had trouble with.
- Task description: Here is the relevant theory for the test given to students: <Textbook chapter>
- Text to be evaluated: <Student test answers>

Output is then the language models evaluation whether the test is correct.

## Future development
- Select folder, iterate over all answers and summarize an entire class' performance, including feedback to the teacher of areas to focus more on in the future, due to poor performance.
